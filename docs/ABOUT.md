## SESAM

The Semi-Empirical Satellite Accommodation coefficient Model (SESAM) calculates the coefficient of drag, projected area, and force coefficient from a given set of input parameters. The code was developed by Marcin Pilinski and the theoretical framework for this is written up in his [thesis](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/912d/411295e005da3a531bf5c0fb03b749f48461.pdf).
